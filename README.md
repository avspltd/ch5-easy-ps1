# ch5-easy-ps1
PowerShell script to do CH5 zip and transfer using 7z and pscp/plink

After struggling to get the official NPM package license terms adopted in enterprise, I figured the simplest path
to have working CI deployments for dynamically created CH5 files is to use existing tools.

This is a simple PowerShell script that uses 7z, plink and pscp to achieve a similar result to the official tooling.

Plus I hate dependencies!
